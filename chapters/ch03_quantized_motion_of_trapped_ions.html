<h1>Quantized Motion of Trapped Ions</h1>

<p>
In the previous chapter, we described the motion of a trapped ion using classical mechanics. By introducing the pseudopotential approximation, we showed that the ion’s secular motion is well described by a harmonic potential with an experimentally tunable frequency.
</p>
<p>
However, this description implicitly assumes that the ion’s position and momentum can take on arbitrary continuous values. Once the ion is sufficiently cold, such that its energy approaches the scale set by $\hbar \omega_{sec}$, this assumption breaks down. At that point, the ion’s motional degrees of freedom must be treated quantum mechanically.
</p>
<p>
In this chapter, we apply the postulates of quantum mechanics to the motional degrees of freedom of a trapped ion. We will see that the classical harmonic motion derived previously naturally becomes a quantum harmonic oscillator, with discrete energy levels and quantized excitations known as phonons. 
</p>

<p>
Throughout this chapter, we focus exclusively on the ion’s secular motion described by the pseudopotential. The fast micromotion, which is phase-locked to the RF drive, will be treated as a classical modulation and will not be quantized.
</p>

<b>Classical to Quantum</b>
<p>
We start by recalling that the classical Hamilitonian describes the total energy of a physical system and is expressed by the sum of the kinetic and potential energies:
</p>
<p>
\[
\ H = T + V
\tag{3.1} 
\]
</p>
  
<p>
where the kinectic energy is commonly expressed in terms of momentum $T = \frac{p^2}{2m}$. The potential energy is the total potential energy we derived previously:
</p>
<p>
\[
\ V = U_{tot} = \frac{1}{2} m \omega_{sec}^2 (X^2 + Y^2) + \frac{\omega_z^2}{Z^2}
\tag{3.2}
\]
</p>
