# Physics for Trapped Ion Quantum Computing

The course outline is provided here for you to follow:

Part I: Foundational Physics
1. Quantum Mechanics
   
     •	Postulates and Examples
  
3. Trapped Ion Systems

     •	Paul Traps

     •	Radio Frequency Fields
  
     •	Micromotion vs. Secular Motion
  
Part II: Quantum Computing with Trapped Ions

5. How an Ion Becomes a Qubit

     •	Choosing levels for $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$.
  
     •	Coherence Time
  
     •	Measurement and Readout
  
6. Single-Qubit Logic
   
     •	Rabi oscillations
  
     •	Laser pulses as rotations.
  
7. Two-Qubit Logic
   
     •	Shared vibrations between ions.
  
     •	Mølmer–Sørensen gate (quick math + the intuition).
  
Part III: The Bigger Picture

8. Errors, Noise, and Why It Matters
    
     •	Decoherence (quantum’s archnemesis)
  
     •	Error correction (without the heavy theory.)
