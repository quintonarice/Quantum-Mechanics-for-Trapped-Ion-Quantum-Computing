<h1>Quantized Motion of Trapped Ions</h1>

<p>
In the previous chapter, we described the motion of a trapped ion using classical mechanics. By introducing the pseudopotential approximation, we showed that the ion’s secular motion is well described by a harmonic potential with an experimentally tunable frequency.
</p>
<p>
However, this description implicitly assumes that the ion’s position and momentum can take on arbitrary continuous values. When the thermal energy greatly exceeds the motional energy spacing $\hbar \omega_{sec}$, the discrete level structure is experimentally unresolved and the motion is well approximated as continuous. Once the ion is cooled such that $k_B T \leq \hbar \omega_{sec}$, this continuum approximation fails and the quantized nature of the motional degrees of freedom becomes essential. At that point, the ion’s motional degrees of freedom must be treated quantum mechanically.
</p>
<p>
In this chapter, we apply the postulates of quantum mechanics to the motional degrees of freedom of a trapped ion. We will see that the classical harmonic motion derived previously naturally becomes a quantum harmonic oscillator, with discrete energy levels and quantized excitations known as phonons. 
</p>

<p>
Throughout this chapter, we focus exclusively on the ion’s secular motion described by the pseudopotential. The fast micromotion, which is phase-locked to the RF drive, will be treated as a classical modulation and will not be quantized.
</p>

<b>Classical to Quantum</b>
<p>
We start by recalling that the classical Hamilitonian describes the total energy of a physical system and is expressed by the sum of the kinetic and potential energies:
</p>
<p>
\[
\ H = T + V
\tag{3.1} 
\]
</p>
  
<p>
where the kinectic energy is commonly expressed in terms of momentum $T = \frac{P^2}{2m}$. The potential energy is the total potential energy we derived previously:
</p>
<p>
\[
\ V = U_{tot} = \frac{1}{2} m \omega_{sec}'^2 (X^2 + Y^2) + \frac{1}{2} m \omega_z^2 Z^2
\tag{3.2}
\]
</p>

<p>
For now, we will restrict our quantization to the axial motion returning later the the radial motion as we will see the process is identical. Therefore:
</p>

<p>
\[
\ H = \frac{P_Z^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega_z^2 Z^2
\tag{3.3}
\]
</p>

<p>
The classical secular axial motion of a trapped ion is therefore governed by the Hamiltonian of a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. According to Postulate $2'$, the time evolution of a quantum system is governed by the Schrödinger equation. Applying this postulate to the ion’s axial motion, requires that we promote the classical representation of position and momentum their quantum representation such that $Z \rightarrow \hat Z$ and $P_Z \rightarrow -i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial Z}$ then the Hamilitonian operator is given by:
</p>
<p>
\[
\ \hat H = \frac{\hat P_Z^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega_z^2 \hat Z^2
\tag{3.4}
\]
</p>
  
<p>
The Schrodinger Equation then tells us that:
</p>

<p>
\[
\ i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} |\psi (Z,t) \rangle = \hat H |\psi (Z,t) \rangle
\tag{3.5}
\]
</p>
  
<p>
Explicitly, we have:
</p>

<p>
\[
\ i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} |\psi (Z,t) \rangle = [-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial Z^2} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega_z^2 Z^2]|\psi (Z,t) \rangle
\tag{3.6}
\]
</p>
  
<p>
Because the Hamiltonian is time-independent, we seek solutions of separable form:
</p>

<p>
\[
\ |\psi (Z,t) \rangle = \phi(Z) e^{\frac{-iEt}{\hbar}}
\tag{3.7}
\]
</p>

<p>
Upon substituting equation 3.7 into equation 3.6 we arrive at:
</p>

<p>
\[
\ [-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial Z^2} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega_z^2 Z^2]|\phi(Z) = E \phi (Z)
\tag{3.8}
\]
</p>

<p>
You may remember from introductory quantum mechanics that the harmonic oscillator can be solved algebraically using ladder operators. This approach not only simplifies the calculation of energy eigenvalues, but also reveals a deep physical structure underlying the motion. We now apply this method to the axial motion of a trapped ion.
</p>
<p>
Our goal is to express the Hamiltonian in terms of operators that raise or lower the energy of a given motional state by a fixed amount. Then, the so-called <b>ladder operators</b> are defined as:
</p>

<p>
\[
\begin{align}
\hat a
&=
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \hbar m \omega_z}}
\left(
m \omega_z \hat Z + i \hat P_Z
\right)
\\[6pt]
\hat a^\dagger
&=
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \hbar m \omega_z}}
\left(
m \omega_z \hat Z - i \hat P_Z
\right)
\end{align}
\tag{3.9}
\]
</p>

<p>
The ladder operators are dimensionless, linear combinations of position and momentum constructed by P. A. M. Dirac to simplify the Hamilitonian. It should be noted and verified by the reader the $[\hat a, \hat a^\dagger] = 1$ which follows from the canonical commutation relation $[\hat Z, \hat P_Z] = i \hbar$.
</p>  

<p>
The exercise below requires verification of the following:
</p>
  
<p>
\[
\ \hat H = \frac{\hat P_Z^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega_z^2 \hat Z^2 = \hbar \omega_z \big (\hat a^\dagger \hat a + \frac{1}{2})
\tag{3.10}
\]
</p>
  
<p>
Perhaps the easiest way is to simply plug in the ladder operators and brute force the algebra keeping the commutation relation in mind.
</p>

<button class="collapsible">Exercise 3.1</button>
<div class="content-box">
Verify explicitly equation 3.10.
</div>

<p>
Following the standard approach, we define the <b>number operator</b>:
</p>

<p>
\[
\ \hat N \equiv \hat a^\dagger a
\tag{3.11}
\]
</p>

<p>
If we now compute the commutators $[\hat N, \hat a]$ and $[\hat N, \hat a^\dagger]$, we see that:
</p>

<p>
\[
\begin{align}
\ [\hat N, \hat a] &= -\hat a \\
  [\hat N, \hat a^\dagger] &= +\hat a^\dagger \\
\end{align}
\tag{3.12}
\]
</p>

This means that $\hat a$ lowers eigenvalues of $\hat N$ while $\hat a^\dagger$ raises eigenvalues of $\hat N$.

<button class="collapsible">Exercise 3.2</button>
<div class="content-box">
<p>
(a) Show that if <b>one</b> eigenstate, $|\lambda\rangle$, exists: $\hat N|\lambda\rangle = \lambda |\lambda\rangle$ then there must be an infinte ladder.
</p>
<p>
(b) Compute the expectation value of $\hat N$ and show that the eigenvalues $\lambda \rightarrow 0,1,2...$
</p>
</div>

<p>
Based on Exercise 3.2, we now have:
</p>

<p>
\[
\ \hat N |n\rangle = n|n\rangle
\tag{3.13}
\]
</p>

<p>
Therefore:
</p>
<p>
\[
\ \hat H |n\rangle = \hbar \omega_z \big(\hat a^\dagger \hat a +\frac{1}{2}) |n\rangle = \hbar \omega_z \big(n + \frac{1}{2} |n\rangle
\tag{3.14}
\]
</p>

<p>
So that the energy eigenvalues:
</p>

<p>
\[
\ E_n = \hbar \omega_z \big(n + \frac{1}{2}
\tag{3.15}
\]
</p>

<p>
A well known result which is absolutely worth deriving.
