<h1>Trapped Ions</h1>

<p>
In this section we transition to discuss the physical system that will ultimately serve as the platform for our quantum computer: trapped atomic ions.
In 2000, D. P. DiVincenzo published, The physical implementation of quantum computation, in Fortschritte der Physik: Progress of Physics, 48, 771-783 which outlined five criteria for required for the realization of a quantum computer. 
</p>

<p> <b>DiVicenzo's Criteria:</b>
</p>
<p>
1.(a) Qubits must be well characterized and easy to produce.
</p>
<p>  
(b) the system must be scalable, i.e. must be able to manage an arbitrary number of qubits.
</p>
<p>
2. It must be possible to reliably initialize a qubit to a fiducial state, e.g. $|0\rangle$;
</p>
<p>
3. A qubit must be stable over timescales larger than the typical time needed to operate
on it. The lifespan of a qubit over which it can maintain its quantum information content (before noise starts to destroy it) is known as coherence time. For a viable QC
system, the coherence time of the qubit must be greater than the computation time.
</p>
<p>
4. It must be possible to implement a universal set of quantum gates.
</p>
<p>
5. A reliable procedure must exist to read out the state of a qubit.
</p>
<p>
While several physical platforms can, in principle, fulfill DiVincenzo’s criteria, we focus on atomic ions because many of these requirements are naturally satisfied by isolated atomic systems.
In particular, qubits encoded in internal atomic states are identical from ion to ion and do not rely on fabrication.
Atomic ion energy levels are well understood through atomic structure theory and spectroscopy in addition to being <i>"easy"</i> to produce using standard photoionization techniques.
By <i>"easy"</i> we mean in a predictable and reliable fashion.
</p>
<p>
Atomic ions satisfy the scalability criteria because each ion is an independent, identical quantum system; adding another ion therefore adds another qubit.
We will discuss <i>hardware scalability</i> in later sections as it is distinct from <i>system scalability</i>.
</p>
<p>
Reliable initialization is accomplished through optical pumping which drives atomic transitions into single internal states
via laser excitation with high fidelity. Stability is achieved with an ultra-high vacuuum environment which isolate ions from uncontrolled interactions and results in long coherence times on the order seconds while
the time it takes to enact a computation occurs on the order of microseconds to milliseconds.
</p>
<p>  
A universal set of quantum gates is implemented through controlled laser excitation of the ions.
These gates are unitary operations and therefore possess the same mathematical properties discussed in Postulate 2 of quantum mechanics.
Lastly, atomic ions use state-dependent fluorescence for measurement which acts as the read out of the qubit state.
</p>

<p>
While atomic ions satisfy the requirements for a physical implementation of a quantum computer, an immediate practical question remains:
how can a device be constructed to exploit the quantum mechanical properties of atomic ions for computation?
To begin, we must consider the following: Unlike neutral atoms, ions experience strong forces in electric fields and cannot simply be left free in vacuum.
Therefore, confinement or trapping of a charged particle is critical for the physical aparatus based on atomic ions.
In the remainder of this chapter, we develop the physical principles underlying trapped-ion systems returngin to DiVincenzo's criteria to come full circle.

<h2>Charge Trapping</h2>

<p>
Since ions are charged particles confinement is both possible and nontrivial. To appreciate why ion trapping is subtle, we begin with an important limitation of classical electromagnetism known as <b>Earnshaw's Theorem</b>.
</p>

<p>
Earnshaw's Theorem states that a charged particle cannot be maintained in a <b>stable</b> equilibrium configuration by electrostatic forces alone.
Stable equilibrium implies that small perturbations on the charge do not break the equilibrium and the charge returns to its equilibrium position after perturbation.
According to Gauss' Law, the divergence of an electrostatic field is proportional to the charge density in the region so in free space the E-field is divergenceless.
</p>
  
<p>
\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0} = 0
\tag{2.1}
\]
</p>

<p>
Since the electric field is minus the gradient of the electric potential, the potential satisfies Laplace's equation in regions with no charge. 

<p>
Stable confinement of a charged particle in three dimensions would require the electrostatic potential to exhibit positive curvature in all directions, 
corresponding to restoring forces for small displacements. However, Laplace’s equation imposes no such condition: it requires only that the sum of the second derivatives of the potential vanish.
As a result, if the curvature is positive in some directions, it must be negative in at least one other direction, leading to an instability along that direction.
</p>

<hr>




<p>
Earnshaw’s theorem states that it is impossible to achieve stable confinement of a charged particle using only static electric fields in free space.
</p>



<p>
Because the electric potential must satisfy Laplace’s equation in regions without charge, any static equilibrium point must be unstable along at least one direction. This means that purely static electric fields cannot trap ions in three dimensions.
</p>

<button class="collapsible">Exercise 2.1</button>
<div class="content-box">
Show that a local minimum of the electric potential is incompatible with Laplace’s equation in free space.
</div>

<p>
If static electric fields cannot trap ions, we must look for an alternative.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>2.3 Time-Dependent Electric Fields</h2>

<p>
The key insight behind ion trapping is that Earnshaw’s theorem applies only to static fields. By allowing the electric potential to vary in time, it becomes possible to achieve effective confinement.
</p>

<p>
In radio-frequency (RF) ion traps, electric fields oscillate rapidly compared to the typical motion of the ion. Although the instantaneous force may not be confining, the time-averaged motion can be stable.
</p>

<p>
This idea underlies the operation of the Paul trap, which is the central trapping technology used in modern trapped-ion quantum computers.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>2.4 Quadrupole Potentials</h2>

<p>
To understand RF trapping quantitatively, we begin with an idealized quadrupole electric potential. Near the center of the trap, the potential can be approximated as quadratic in position.
</p>

<p><span class="eq-placeholder">(2.2) [Insert ideal quadrupole potential]</span></p>

<p>
In practice, this potential is generated by applying a combination of static (DC) and oscillating (RF) voltages to carefully shaped electrodes.
</p>

<figure>
  <p><i>[Figure 2.1 Placeholder: Quadrupole electrode geometry]</i></p>
</figure>

<p>
The resulting electric field produces forces that alternate between focusing and defocusing directions as the RF voltage oscillates.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>2.5 Equations of Motion</h2>

<p>
The motion of an ion in an electric field is governed by Newton’s second law. Substituting the quadrupole potential into the force law leads to a set of coupled, time-dependent differential equations.
</p>

<p><span class="eq-placeholder">(2.3) [Insert equation of motion for x-direction]</span></p>
<p><span class="eq-placeholder">(2.4) [Insert equation of motion for y-direction]</span></p>

<p>
After introducing dimensionless parameters and rescaling time, these equations take a standard mathematical form known as the Mathieu equation.
</p>

<p>
We do not derive this result here. A full derivation starting from the electric potential and leading to the Mathieu equation is provided in Appendix A.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>2.6 The Mathieu Equation</h2>

<p>
The canonical Mathieu equation has the form:
</p>

<p><span class="eq-placeholder">(2.5) [Insert Mathieu equation]</span></p>

<p>
The parameters appearing in this equation encode the physical properties of the trap, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>ion mass and charge</li>
  <li>trap geometry</li>
  <li>RF drive amplitude and frequency</li>
</ul>

<p>
Solutions to the Mathieu equation are either stable or unstable depending on the values of these parameters.
</p>

<div class="content-box">

</div>

<hr>

<h2>2.7 Secular Motion and Micromotion</h2>

<p>
In the experimentally relevant regime, the ion’s motion can be separated into two components:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a slow, smooth oscillation called <b>secular motion</b></li>
  <li>a rapid oscillation at the RF drive frequency called <b>micromotion</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
This separation becomes valid when one of the Mathieu parameters is small.
</p>

<p><span class="eq-placeholder">(2.6) [Insert approximate secular frequency]</span></p>

<p>
The secular motion resembles that of a particle in a harmonic potential, a fact that will become crucial when we later quantize the ion’s motion.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>2.8 The Pseudopotential Approximation</h2>

<p>
Rather than working directly with the full time-dependent equations of motion, it is often convenient to describe the ion as moving in an effective, time-independent potential known as the pseudopotential.
</p>

<p><span class="eq-placeholder">(2.7) [Insert pseudopotential expression]</span></p>

<p>
The pseudopotential provides a simple and intuitive picture of ion confinement and allows us to estimate trap depths and motional frequencies.
</p>

<div class="content-box">
Under what conditions does the pseudopotential approximation break down?
</div>

<hr>

<h2>2.9 Outlook: From Classical Motion to Quantum Mechanics</h2>

<p>
In this chapter we have treated the ion’s motion classically. However, once the ion is sufficiently cold, its motional degrees of freedom must be described quantum mechanically.
</p>

<p>
In the next chapter we will quantize the ion’s motion, introduce phonon modes, and connect this picture to the internal electronic states of the ion. These ingredients together form the foundation of trapped-ion quantum computation.
