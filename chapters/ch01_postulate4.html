<h2>Postulate 4 of Quantum Mechanics</h2>

<b>Learning Objectives:</b>
<p>After completing this section, the reader should be able to:</p>
<p>
1. Describe the state space of a composite quantum system as a tensor product of individual state spaces, and explain how joint quantum states are constructed.
</p>
2. Apply the defining properties of the tensor product, including linearity and bilinearity, to composite quantum states.
<p>
3. Interpret the shorthand notation $|v w\ranlge$ as a tensor product, and explain why this notation is consistent with the axioms of linear vector spaces.
</p>
<p>
4. Compute tensor products of finite-dimensional quantum states explicitly, using the Kronecker product representation.
</p>
<p>
5. Distinguish between single-system superposition and multi-system composition, and explain how tensor products enlarge the state space dimension.
</p>
  
<p>
The state space of a composite physical system is the <b>tensor product</b> of the state space of the component physical systems. If we have systems numbered 1 through $n$ and system $i$ is prepared in the state $|\psi_i\rangle$, then the joint state of the total system is:
</p>

<p>
\[
|\Psi\rangle = |\psi_1\rangle \otimes |\psi_2\rangle \otimes \cdots \otimes |\psi_n\rangle
\tag{1.99}
\]
</p>


<p>
Where $\otimes$ represents the tensor product. A tensor product is a vector space equipped with a bilinear map.
</p>

<p>
To understand tensor products, we’ll start with a concrete example. Given that $V$ and $W$ are finite dimensional vector spaces where $V$ belongs to $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $W$ belongs to $\mathbb{R}^m$ for $n$ and $m$, respectively, as positive integers.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, the vector $v$ has $n$ values while vector $w$ has $m$ values. We now examine $V\otimes W$. This tensor product is an mn dimensional vector space where the elements are linear combinations of $v \otimes w$.
</p>

<p>
For example, if $V$ is a 2-dimensional vector space with basis vectors $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ then $|0\rangle \otimes|0\rangle + |1\rangle \otimes |1\rangle$ is an element of $V \otimes W$.
</p>

<p>
The tensor product satisfies the following properties from linear algebra:
</p>

<p>
Property 1: $z(v \otimes w) = (zv) \otimes w = v \otimes (zw)$ for scalar $z$.
</p>

<p>
Property 2: $(v_1+ v_2) \otimes w = v_1 \otimes w + v_2 \otimes w$.
</p>

<p>
Property 3: $v \otimes (w_1 + w_2) = v \otimes w_1 + v \otimes w_2$.
</p>

<button class="collapsible">Exercise 1.15</button>
<div class="content-box">
Using explicit vectors, verify Properties 2 and 3 of the tensor product
by expanding both sides of each equation and showing they are equal.
</div>

<p>
Now, if a system $A$ is in $|v\rangle$ and a system $B$ is in $|w\rangle$ then we may write the joint state as $|v\rangle|w\rangle$.
</p>

<p>
But it is not clear what this notation implies just yet.
</p>

<p>
First, notice that if $|v\rangle|w\rangle$ is a valid quantum mechanical state, then $z|v\rangle|w\rangle$ is also a valid state because we can always multiply state vectors by complex numbers.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, Hilbert spaces (where the state vectors live) are linear vector spaces in which composite states must respect scalar multiplication in each vector space independently.
</p>

<p>
\[
z(|v\rangle \otimes |w\rangle) = (z|v\rangle)\otimes |w\rangle
\tag{1.100}
\]
</p>


<p>
As well as:
</p>

<p>
\[
z(|v\rangle \otimes |w\rangle) = |v\rangle \otimes (z|w\rangle)
\tag{1.101}
\]
</p>


<p>
So, if we were to define |v⟩|w⟩ ≡ |v⟩ ⊗ |w⟩ it would readily obey Property 1 by default.
</p>

<p>
Now, let’s say that some states |v<sub>1</sub>⟩ and |v<sub>2</sub>⟩ are states of system A and are superposed such that:
</p>

<p>
\[
|v\rangle = |v_1\rangle + |v_2\rangle
\tag{1.102}
\]
</p>


<p>
This is a valid state although it is unnormalized. The composite system would be:
</p>

<p>
\[
|v\rangle|w\rangle = |v_1\rangle|w\rangle + |v_2\rangle|w\rangle
\tag{1.103}
\]
</p>


<p>
Which obeys Property 2 if $|v\rangle|w\rangle ≡ |v\rangle \otimes |w\rangle$.
</p>

<p>
It is beginning to look more and more like the object $|v\rangle|w\rangle$ is indeed a tensor product.
</p>

<p>
Let’s finalize this result. We could of course say that system $B$ has superposed states of $|w_1\rangle$ and $|w_2\rangle$ which are valid.
</p>

<p>
Thus, the composite is:
</p>

<p>
\[
|v\rangle(|w_1\rangle + |w_2\rangle)
= |v\rangle|w_1\rangle + |v\rangle|w_2\rangle
\tag{1.104}
\]
</p>


<p>
Which is exactly Property 3 as long as $|v\rangle|w\rangle ≡ |v\rangle \otimes |w\rangle$.
</p>

<p>
Since the object |v⟩|w⟩ obeys all the properties of a tensor product we say that it is a tensor product (up to isomorphism).
</p>

<p>
Operationally, the tensor product can be computed using the Kronecker Product for matrices.
</p>

<p>
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
a \\
b
\end{pmatrix}
\otimes
\begin{pmatrix}
c \\
d
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
ac \\
ad \\
bc \\
bd
\end{pmatrix}
\tag{1.105}
\]
</p>

<div class="content-box">
Compute the tensor product |0⟩⊗|1⟩ and |1⟩⊗|0⟩ using the Kronecker
product of column vectors.  
Write each result as a 4-component column vector.
</div>
    
<p>
Lastly, here is common notation concerning tensor products:
</p>

<p>
\[
|\psi\rangle^{\otimes k}
= \underbrace{|\psi\rangle \otimes \cdots \otimes |\psi\rangle}_{k\ \text{times}}
\tag{1.106}
\]
</p>


<p>
Additionally, physicists commonly use the shorthand $|vw\rangle = |v\rangle \otimes|w\rangle$ for more compact expression.
