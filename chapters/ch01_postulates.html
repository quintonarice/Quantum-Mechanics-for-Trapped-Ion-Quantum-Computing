<h1>Postulates of Quantum Mechanics</h1>

<p>
We begin with the Postulates of Quantum Mechanics in an attempt to set the framework for which quantum computing is performed. If and when you get confused about “why”, it is good practice to remember the definition of a postulate: a thing suggested or assumed as true as the basis for reasoning, discussion, or belief. This means that since this is the framework for all quantum mechanics discussed in this book, we must take these statements at face value. 
</p>

<p>
<br>
<b>Postulate 1 of Quantum Mechanics</b>
<br><br>
</p>

<p>
An isolated system is associated with a complex vector space with an inner product known as the state space. The system is described by its state vector, which is a unit vector in the system’s state space.
</p>

<p>
Let us work through the meaning of the above statement. First, let us begin by reviewing real vectors, which should be familiar from introductory physics. A real vector in 2-dimensions can be written as:
</p>

<p>
$$
\vec{v} = v_x \hat{x} + v_y \hat{y}
$$
</p>

<p>
This can equivalently be written as a column matrix:
</p>

<p>
$$
\vec{v} =
\begin{bmatrix}
v_x \\
v_y
\end{bmatrix}
$$
</p>

<p>
To generalize the dot product to matrix form, consider two vectors:
</p>

<p>
$$
\vec{v} =
\begin{bmatrix}
v_x \\
v_y
\end{bmatrix},
\qquad
\vec{w} =
\begin{bmatrix}
w_x \\
w_y
\end{bmatrix}
$$
</p>

<p>
Their dot product is:
</p>

<p>
$$
\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w} = v_x w_x + v_y w_y
$$
</p>

<p>
In matrix form:
</p>

<p>
$$
\vec{v}^T \vec{w} =
\begin{bmatrix}
v_x & v_y
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
w_x \\
w_y
\end{bmatrix}
$$
</p>

<p>
The magnitude, or length, of a vector is:
</p>

<p>
$$
\|\vec{v}\| = \sqrt{\vec{v}\cdot\vec{v}}
$$
</p>

<p>
So far this has introduced the basic structure used for quantum state vectors, except in quantum mechanics we care about <i>complex</i> vectors, not only real vectors. A complex vector is written in the same column form:
</p>

<p>
$$
|\psi\rangle =
\begin{bmatrix}
a \\
b
\end{bmatrix},
\qquad
a, b \in \mathbb{C}.
$$
</p>

<p>
Quantum mechanics generalizes the dot product to the complex inner product. For two states:
</p>

<p>
$$
|\phi\rangle =
\begin{bmatrix}
\phi_1 \\
\phi_2
\end{bmatrix},
\qquad
|\psi\rangle =
\begin{bmatrix}
\psi_1 \\
\psi_2
\end{bmatrix}
$$
</p>

<p>
the inner product is:
</p>

<p>
$$
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle
= \phi_1^* \psi_1 + \phi_2^* \psi_2.
$$
</p>

<p>
The bra is defined as the conjugate transpose of the ket:
</p>

<p>
$$
\langle \phi | = (|\phi\rangle)^\dagger.
$$
</p>

<p>
A quantum state must satisfy the normalization condition:
</p>

<p>
$$
\langle \psi | \psi \rangle = 1.
$$
</p>

<p>
This ensures the state vector is a unit vector and that the probabilities of measurement outcomes sum to 1.
</p>

<p>
<br>
<b>The Qubit</b>
<br><br>
</p>

<p>
In the context of quantum computing, the quantum state vector is referred to as a qubit. The most basic way to write a qubit is similar to the way we define vectors in 2-dimensions, i.e., a qubit is a vector whose components are complex numbers. However, since the quantum state must be normalized, only some complex vectors are valid qubits.
</p>

<p>
A general qubit is written as a linear combination of two orthonormal basis states, usually denoted \( |0\rangle \) and \( |1\rangle \):
</p>

<p>
$$
|\psi\rangle = \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle
$$
</p>

<p>
where \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are complex numbers. The normalization condition becomes:
</p>

<p>
$$
|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1.
$$
</p>

<p>
For example:
</p>

<p>
$$
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}|0\rangle + \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}|1\rangle
$$
</p>

<p>
is a valid qubit since:
</p>

<p>
$$
\left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right|^2 + \left|\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\right|^2 = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3} = 1.
$$
</p>

<p>
<br>
<b>The Superposition Principle</b>
<br><br>
</p>

<p>
A qubit is often described as being in a superposition of the computational basis states \( |0\rangle \) and \( |1\rangle \). This terminology arises from the linearity of quantum mechanics: if \( |0\rangle \) and \( |1\rangle \) are possible states, then any linear combination of them is also a valid state.
</p>

<p>
Superposition does not mean the system is “physically halfway between 0 and 1.” Rather, it specifies the <i>probability amplitudes</i> that determine the likelihood of measuring 0 or 1.
</p>

<div class="content-box">
Given  
\( |\psi\rangle = \frac{3}{5}|0\rangle + \frac{4}{5}|1\rangle \),  
compute \( P(0) \) and \( P(1) \).
</div>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<b>Complex Amplitudes and Phase</b>
<br><br>
</p>

<p>
The amplitudes \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) may be complex numbers. To understand the role of phase, we write them in polar form:
</p>

<p>
$$
\alpha = r_0 e^{i\phi_0}, \qquad \beta = r_1 e^{i\phi_1}.
$$
</p>

<p>
Inserting these into the general qubit:
</p>

<p>
$$
|\psi\rangle = r_0 e^{i\phi_0}|0\rangle + r_1 e^{i\phi_1}|1\rangle
$$
</p>

<p>
and removing an overall global phase \( e^{i\phi_0} \), which does not affect physics, gives:
</p>

<p>
$$
|\psi\rangle =
\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)|0\rangle +
e^{i\phi} \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)|1\rangle
$$
</p>

<p>
where:
</p>

<p>
$$
\phi = \phi_1 - \phi_0,
\qquad
r_0 = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right),
\qquad
r_1 = \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right).
$$
</p>

<p>
This form is known as the Bloch sphere parameterization.
</p>

<p>
<br>
<b>The Bloch Sphere</b>
<br><br>
</p>

<p>
The Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of the qubit. The angles \( \theta \) and \( \phi \) correspond to spherical coordinates on the unit sphere.
</p>

<ul>
<li>\( \theta = 0 \Rightarrow |0\rangle \) at the north pole</li>
<li>\( \theta = \pi \Rightarrow |1\rangle \) at the south pole</li>
<li>\( \phi \) determines the rotation about the z-axis</li>
</ul>

<p>
Although \( \phi \) originated from a quantum mechanical phase difference, on the Bloch sphere it corresponds to a measurable rotation about the z-axis. This identification is one of the reasons why the Bloch sphere is such a powerful visualization tool.
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauli Operators</b>
<br><br>
</p>

<p>
Quantum computing relies heavily on operators that act on qubits. Three of the most fundamental operators are the Pauli matrices:
</p>

<p>
$$
X =
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix},
\qquad
Y =
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{bmatrix},
\qquad
Z =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
$$
</p>

<p>
Their action on a general qubit \( |\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle \) is:
</p>

<p>
$$
X|\psi\rangle = \alpha|1\rangle + \beta|0\rangle
$$
</p>

<p>
$$
Y|\psi\rangle = i\alpha|1\rangle - i\beta|0\rangle
$$
</p>

<p>
$$
Z|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle - \beta|1\rangle.
$$
</p>

<p>
These operators are unitary, meaning:
</p>

<p>
$$
X^\dagger X = Y^\dagger Y = Z^\dagger Z = I.
$$
</p>

<p><br><b>Postulate 2ʹ of Quantum Mechanics</b><br><br></p>

<p>
The time evolution of the state of a closed quantum system is described by the Schrodinger Equation:
</p>

<p>
<i>[Equation Placeholder: Schrödinger Equation here]</i>
</p>

<p>
Where H is the Hamiltonian (not the Hadamard gate; be careful!). The Hamiltonian is an operator which generates time evolution. This can be “derived” from Postulate 2 by including explicit time-dependence.
</p>

<p>
<i>[Equation Placeholder: Time-evolution operator form]</i>
</p>

<p>
Where ψ(t) is the quantum state vector at some time t, ψ(0) is the quantum state vector at some initial time t = 0, and U(t) is a time-evolution operator that tells us how the initial state changes. We require that:
</p>

<p>
1. The state changes smoothly with t.<br>
2. Evolving 1st by t1 and then by t2 should be the same as t1 + t2:
</p>

<p>
<i>[Equation Placeholder: Composition property]</i>
</p>

<p>
3. U(t) must be unitary to preserve the inner product.
</p>

<p>
The only continuous, unitary operators that satisfy the composition rule (requirement #2) have exponential form:
</p>

<p>
<i>[Equation Placeholder: U(t) = exp(-i A t)]</i>
</p>

<p>
Where A is a Hermitian operator. A Hermitian operator obeys the following:
</p>

<p>
<i>[Equation Placeholder: A† = A]</i>
</p>

<p>
Why should A be Hermitian? Because U(t) must be unitary:
</p>

<p>
<i>[Equation Placeholder: U†U = I → A† = A]</i>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Now we take the time derivative of U(t) to see what happens.
</p>

<p>
<i>[Equation Placeholder: dU/dt expression]</i>
</p>

<p>
Which is the general form of the Schrodinger equation with the implication that A = H/ħ. Therefore, if we know H we know how the system evolves in time. The time-evolution unitary operator can then be written as:
</p>

<p>
<i>[Equation Placeholder: U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)]</i>
</p>

<p>
So, we now have two equation which dictate how states evolve in quantum mechanics:
</p>

<p>
1. <i>[Equation Placeholder: Schrödinger Equation]</i>  Schrodinger Equation<br>
2. <i>[Equation Placeholder: |ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩]</i>  Updated Postulate 2
</p>

<p>
As an exercise, use the updated Postulate 2 and Schrodinger equation to show that:
</p>

<p>
<i>[Equation Placeholder: H|ψ(0)〉 ∝ |ψ(0)〉]</i>
</p>

<p>
The proportionality constant is commonly denoted E for reasons explained below. So, we have:
</p>

<p>
<i>[Equation Placeholder: H|ψ〉 = E|ψ〉]</i>
</p>

<p>
Where we have dropped the function of time notation for simplicity. This gives a result known as the time-independent Schrodinger equation. If an operator acts on a state vector and the state vector is returned multiplied by a constant, the state is called an eigenstate of the operator, and the constant is its eigenvalue. The Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian forces the eigenvalues to be real and therefore we can assign the measurable allowed energies of the system to the eigenvalues while the eigenstates are known more specifically as the energy eigenstates. Another way of writing this is:
</p>

<p>
<i>[Equation Placeholder: H|E〉 = E|E〉]</i>
</p>

<p>
|E⟩ are also known asstationary states of the system because they do not change with time.
</p>
