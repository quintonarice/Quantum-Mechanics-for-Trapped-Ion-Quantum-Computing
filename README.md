Introduction to QM for Trapped Ion Quantum Computing

The course outline is provided here for you to follow:

Part I: Essential Physics for Quantum Computing
1. Quantum Essentials
   
     •	Postulates of QM
  
3. Trapping Ions

     •	Paul Traps

     •	RF fields (Ions vs. Dust)
  
     •	Micromotion vs. Secular Motion
  
Part II: Computing with Trapped Ions
5. How an Ion Becomes a Qubit

     •	Choosing levels for |0⟩ and |1⟩.
  
     •	Coherence Time
  
     •	Measurement and Readout
  
6. Single-Qubit Logic
   
     •	Rabi oscillations (simple)
  
     •	Laser pulses as rotations.
  
8. Two-Qubit Logic
   
     •	Shared vibrations between ions.
  
     •	Mølmer–Sørensen gate (quick math + the intuition).
  
Part III: The Bigger Picture

10. Errors, Noise, and Why It Matters
    
     •	Decoherence (quantum’s archnemesis)
  
     •	Error correction (without the heavy theory.)
