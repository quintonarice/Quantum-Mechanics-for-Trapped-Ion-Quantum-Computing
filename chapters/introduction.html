<h1>All the Physics You Need for Ion-Trapped Quantum Computing</h1>
<h2>A Practical Guide to Ion-Trap Quantum Computing</h2>
<h3>By Quinton Rice</h3>

<hr>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p> You may have heard of quantum computing, or you may in fact be interested in the future of quantum information science. You might also be familiar with classical computers since the majority of us have one either in our pocket right now (cellphone) or somewhere close by (laptop/desktop). Have you ever stopped to wonder about how these devices work on a fundamental level? How can a combination of circuits and microchips be combined to give us the most technologically advanced device in human history? This book will not answer that question. Instead, we simply note that since it is possible to create such a device using classical techniques, it should also be possible to use quantum techniques. What we will find is that there are some advantages and disadvantages of the quantum approach.
<p> You may recall seeing images of some of the very first classical computers; the giant refrigerator shaped monstrosities which filled entire rooms and required teams of scientists to operate. The reason these computers were so large is because they used vacuum tube technology as the building block for computation. A vacuum tube is exactly what it sounds like. It is an enclosed glass tube in which all the air has been removed. Inside there are 3 components:

<p>1. <b>Cathode:</b> a heated wire which emits electrons through thermionic emission.</p>
<p>2. <b>Anode:</b> a metal surface held at positive voltage that attracts the electrons</p>
<p>3. <b>Control grid:</b> a fine metal mesh placed between the cathode and anode.</p>
<p>The cathode is connected to the negative terminal of a power supply, providing continuous electrons for emission in the tube, while the anode is connected to the positive terminal. The control grid can be neutral or have negative voltage. If the control grid is neutral, electrons flow undisturbed to the anode. If the control grid is negative, electrons are repelled away from the anode. This system is the basic on/off switch needed to define a “bit”. Current is the flow of electrons, so therefore the vacuum tube is “on” when there is current and “off” when there is no current.</p>

<p>Some of the first digital computers used about 17,000 vacuum tubes ranging in size from 2 – 4 inches with a 1-inch diameter. Since the tubes are similar to tiny light bulbs, power consumption and heating/cooling requirements only added to total size of the machines.</p>
  
<p>In 1947, John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley built the first transistor. The transistor plays the same logical role as the vacuum tube only now a solid semiconductor crystal is used. The simplest type is the Bipolar junction transistor (BJT) which is operationally identical to the vacuum tube. For the BJT, there are 3 components:</p>

<p>1. <b>Emitter:</b> source of electrons.</p>
<p>2. <b>Collector:</b> receives electrons.</p>
<p>3. <b>Base:</b> Controls current flow based on applied voltage.</p>

<p>In an NPN transistor, the emitter and collector are two different semiconductors both with an excess of free electrons as the charge carriers, making them n-type semiconductors while the base is a p-type semiconductor with an excess of holes or “missing” electrons. (A PNP transistor is just the opposite). The process of making a semiconductor more positive or negative is called doping. The primary function of the base is to control electron flow from the emitter to the collector by applying a voltage across the device. (See the Appendix for a more detailed description of P-N Junctions.) Now, when there is an applied voltage, the transistor is “on” and when there is no applied voltage, the transistor is “off” similar to the vacuum tube from before.</p>

<p>One of the many advantages of the transistor over the vacuum tube is its size. The first BJTs were about a millimeter in size with the base being on the order of 100s of micrometers thick while modern transistors (MOSFETs) are on the order of a few nanometers. The decrease in size allows electrons to flow across the base in femtoseconds rather than nanoseconds significantly speeding up the on/off switching process. By harnessing the technology of solid-state physics, devices can be made smaller, faster, and more efficient. Even the number of transistors which can fit on an integrated circuit chip tends to double every 2 years according to Moore’s Law. At this moment, the limits of classical physics are being tested as transistor size approaches less than one hundred atoms in length; a regime in which quantum properties become more evident and the concrete notion of “on/off” used in transistors and vacuum tubes comes crashing down.</p>

<p>These inherent quantum properties such as electron tunneling and interference are unavoidable as transistor size shrinks. Rather than design elaborate schemes to fight a losing battle, physicists thought to use them as the basis for a new type of computer. Thus, the advent of the quantum computer. There is a rich and fascinating history of quantum computation, too vast to cover here, so instead, we will focus on the essential physical principles that underlie it. A quantum computer switches between quantum states rather than classical states of “on” or “off” discussed previously. Quantum states can exist in superposition which allows them to be both “on” and “off” simultaneously. Consider, the light switch analogy. The classical light switch can be in the “on” position or the “off” position. A quantum light switch, however, can be in between “on” and “off” until you decide to measure it. Then it will become “on” or “off” depending on your measurement. It does not sound all that useful at first, but the key is you can manipulate it before measuring. This is what gives the quantum computer its power as we will see shortly.</p>

<p><b>Physical Quantum Computers</b></p>
  
<p>There are several ways to realize a qubit and thus a quantum computer which directly manipulates them for computation. The most popular techniques involve optical, solid-state, and atomic set ups. Optical quantum computers may use photon polarization states as qubits, while superconducting quantum computers use micro-LC circuits. We will primarily focus on trapped-ion systems for several reasons which will become clear as we work through the definitions.</p>

<p>Earlier we learned that computers need something that can switch between two or more different configurations. In a classical system, we identify these as bits which can be either “on” or “off”. From now on we will refer to “on” as 1 and “off” as 0. This is where the modern power switch symbols come from. Classical bits can only ever be 1 or 0 meaning their classical state is either 1 or 0. In a quantum system, the quantum states function as our bits and are therefore called quantum bits or qubits. As mentioned previously, qubits can be in a superposition of 1 and 0 before measurement which allows for useful pre-measurement manipulation before collapsing to 1 or 0. The idea of a quantum state or qubit is a logical departure from the concreteness of the working principle of a transistor. Let us focus on the meaning of a quantum state.</p>

  
<p><b>Warning:</b> This course contains math—vectors, complex numbers, linear algebra, and differential equations.  
It also attempts to derive more equations and show more steps than a typical textbook to remove potential confusion. However, some exercises/steps are left to the reader on purpose to encourage engagement and learning.</p>
