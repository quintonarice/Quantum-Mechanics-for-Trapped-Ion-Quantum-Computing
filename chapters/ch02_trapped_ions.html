<h1>Trapped Ions</h1>

<p>
In this section we transition to discuss the physical system that will ultimately serve as the platform for our quantum computer: trapped atomic ions.
In 2000, D. P. DiVincenzo published, The physical implementation of quantum computation, in Fortschritte der Physik: Progress of Physics, 48, 771-783 which outlined five criteria for required for the realization of a quantum computer. 
</p>

<p> <b>DiVicenzo's Criteria:</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>1.(a)</b> Qubits must be well characterized and easy to produce.
</p>
<p>  
<b>(b)</b> the system must be scalable, i.e. must be able to manage an arbitrary number of qubits.
</p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> It must be possible to reliably initialize a qubit to a fiducial state, e.g. $|0\rangle$;
</p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> A qubit must be stable over timescales larger than the typical time needed to operate
on it. The lifespan of a qubit over which it can maintain its quantum information content (before noise starts to destroy it) is known as coherence time. For a viable QC
system, the coherence time of the qubit must be greater than the computation time.
</p>
<p>
<b>4.</b> It must be possible to implement a universal set of quantum gates.
</p>
<p>
<b>5.</b> A reliable procedure must exist to read out the state of a qubit.
</p>
  
<p>
While several physical platforms can, in principle, fulfill DiVincenzo’s criteria, we focus on atomic ions because many of these requirements are naturally satisfied by isolated atomic systems.
In particular, qubits encoded in internal atomic states are identical from ion to ion and do not rely on fabrication.
Atomic ion energy levels are well understood through atomic structure theory and spectroscopy in addition to being <i>"easy"</i> to produce using standard photoionization techniques.
By <i>"easy"</i> we mean in a predictable and reliable fashion.
</p>
<p>
Atomic ions satisfy the scalability criteria because each ion is an independent, identical quantum system; adding another ion therefore adds another qubit.
We will discuss <i>hardware scalability</i> in later sections as it is distinct from <i>system scalability</i>.
</p>
<p>
Reliable initialization is accomplished through optical pumping which drives atomic transitions into single internal states
via laser excitation with high fidelity. Stability is achieved with an ultra-high vacuuum environment which isolate ions from uncontrolled interactions and results in long coherence times on the order seconds while
the time it takes to enact a computation occurs on the order of microseconds to milliseconds.
</p>
<p>  
A universal set of quantum gates is implemented through controlled laser excitation of the ions.
These gates are unitary operations and therefore possess the same mathematical properties discussed in Postulate 2 of quantum mechanics.
Lastly, atomic ions use state-dependent fluorescence for measurement which acts as the read out of the qubit state.
</p>

<p>
While atomic ions satisfy the requirements for a physical implementation of a quantum computer, an immediate practical question remains:
how can a device be constructed to exploit the quantum mechanical properties of atomic ions for computation?
To begin, we must consider the following: Unlike neutral atoms, ions experience strong forces in electric fields and cannot simply be left free in vacuum.
Therefore, confinement or trapping of a charged particle is critical for the physical aparatus based on atomic ions.
In the remainder of this chapter, we develop the physical principles underlying trapped-ion systems returning to DiVincenzo's criteria to come full circle.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Earnshaw's Theorem</h3>

<p>
Since ions are charged particles confinement is both possible and nontrivial. To appreciate why ion trapping is subtle, we begin with an important limitation of classical electromagnetism known as <b>Earnshaw's Theorem</b>.
</p>

<p>
Earnshaw's Theorem states that a charged particle cannot be maintained in a <b>stable</b> equilibrium configuration by electrostatic forces alone.
Stable equilibrium implies that small perturbations on the charge do not break the equilibrium and the charge returns to its equilibrium position after perturbation.
According to Gauss' Law, the divergence of an electrostatic field is proportional to the charge density in the region so in free space the E-field is divergenceless.
</p>
  
<p>
\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0} = 0
\tag{2.1}
\]
</p>

<p>
Since the electric field is minus the gradient of the electric potential, the potential satisfies Laplace's equation in regions with no charge. 
</p>

<p>
\[
\mathbf{E} = -\nabla\mathbf{V}
\tag{2.2}
\]
</p>
  
<p>
Stable confinement of a charged particle in three dimensions would require the electrostatic potential to exhibit positive curvature in all directions, 
corresponding to restoring forces for small displacements. However, Laplace’s equation imposes no such condition: it requires only that the sum of the second derivatives of the potential vanish.
</p>

<p>
\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}
=
\nabla \cdot (-\nabla V)
=
-\left(
\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial x^2}
+
\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial y^2}
+
\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial z^2}
\right)
=
-\nabla^2 V = 0
\tag{2.3}
\]
</p>

<p>
As a result, if the curvature is positive in some directions, it must be negative in at least one other direction, leading to an instability along that direction.
</p>
<p>This means that purely static electric fields cannot trap ions in three dimensions.</p>

<h2>The Linear Paul Trap</h2>

<p>
The key insight behind ion trapping is that Earnshaw’s theorem applies to electrostatic forces. By allowing the electric potential to vary in time, it becomes possible to achieve effective confinement. Although Laplace’s equation forbids static confinement in all three spatial directions, time-dependent fields can provide dynamical stability. 
</p>
<p>
A linear Paul trap, named after Wolfgang Paul, is an ion trap which operates using rapidly oscillating electric fields at <b>radio frequencies</b> (RF). At any instant the RF quadrupole confines in only two directions, as governed by Laplace, but over many RF cycles the ion experiences a time-averaged restoring force that produces effective radial confinement. Axial confinement can then be supplied by static electric fields without violating Earnshaw’s theorem. We will show that the time-averaged motion can be stable.
</p>
<p>
The typical construction of a linear Paul trap is shown in Figure 2.1 and involves the use of both static and RF fields to achieve stability. This is done by using 4 cylindrical rods which have oscillating RF potential, with each set of diagonal rods in-phase with each other and out-of-phase with the opposite set of rods, which provide radial confinement. Additionally, to 2 static potential endcap electrodes along the $z$-axis provide axial confinement. This combination allows ions to form a linear chain along the axis without being ejected out along the $x$ or $y$ directions.
</p>
  
<figure>
  <p><i>[Figure 2.1 Placeholder: Quadrupole electrode geometry]</i></p>
</figure>
  
<p>
Paul Traps, sometimes called RF traps, are a central technology used in modern trapped-ion quantum computers. Although linear Paul traps achieve axial confinement using static endcap electrodes, fully three-dimensional Paul traps exist in which all confinement is provided dynamically by RF fields. In practice, linear traps are preferred for quantum information applications due to their superior scalability and control.
In the next section we will explore the solution to Laplace's equation under our dynamic constraint and how that informs the construction of a linear Paul trap.
</p>

  
<b>The RF Quadrupole Potential</b>
<p>
The RF quadrupole potential of the linear Paul trap is the simplest nontrivial solution to Laplace’s equation that can produce an equilibrium point using external electrodes. The RF quadrupole potential only has radial components and therefore can be expressed in the form:

<p>
\[
\Phi(x,y,t) \propto x^2 - y^2
\tag{2.4}
\]
</p>

<p>
You can verify that a potential of this form satisfies Laplace's equation. This is why the linear Paul trap consists of 4 rods; along with the axial static electrodes, it is the simplest electrode geometry which allows for charge trapping.
</p>

<p>
The full deriviation involves multivariate Taylor expansion around the equilibrium position and is provided in the Appendix. Nonetheless, we provided some details to truly understand the machinery behind the scenes. After Taylor expansion around the center of the trap, we find that:
</p>
  
<p>
\[
\Phi(x,y,z,t) \approx \Phi(0,0,0,t) + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} \Phi(0,0,0,t) x^2 + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} \Phi(0,0,0,t) y^2 + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2} \Phi(0,0,0,t) z^2
\tag{2.5}
\]
</p>

<p>
where $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2} \Phi(0,0,0,t) z^2 = 0$ because the ideal RF quadrupole has no axial curvature. The axial confinement is provided by the separate static endcaps so that the second derivative $frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2} \Phi(0,0,0,t)$ is zero for the RF quadrupole contribution.
</p>
<p>
Now, applying this to Laplace's equation we get:
</p>
  
<p>
\[
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} \Phi(0,0,0,t) = -\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} \Phi(0,0,0,t)
\tag{2.6}
\]
</p>

<p>
So that:
</p>

<p>
\[
\Phi(x,y,t) \approx \Phi(0,0,t) + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} \Phi(0,0,t) x^2 - \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} \Phi(0,0,t) y^2
\tag{2.7}
\]
</p>
  
<p>
where we have plugged equation 2.6 into equation 2.5 and dropped the explicit $z$ dependence since it does not affect the radial confinement. If we now call $\Phi(0,0,t) = \Phi_0(t)$, we have:
</p>

<p>
\[
\Phi(x,y,t) \approx \Phi_0 + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} \Phi_0(t) (x^2 - y^2)
\tag{2.8}
\]
</p>
  
<p>
To clean up the notation even more, we call $\frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} \Phi_0(t) \Rightarrow C(t)$ so that:
</p>
  
<p>
\[
\Phi(x,y,t) \approx C(t)(x^2 - y^2) + \Phi_0(t)
\tag{2.8}
\]
</p>

<p>
Now, earlier we stated that the 4 rods of the trap are cylindrical but this is mostly due the expense of manufacturing perfectly hyperbolic trap electrodes rather than a physical contraint. In the ideal Paul trap, the surfaces of the trap rods are hyperbolas of the form $x^2 - y^2$ so that the equipotentials in inside the trap are also hyperbolas. Because equipotentials have the same value along each line, the equation must be a constant along that line, (each line would be a different constant) so that $x^2 - y^2 = <i>const</i>$. But what is this constant? To determine it, we use the ideal geometry of the trap shown in Figure 2.2
</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <p><i>[Figure 2.2 Placeholder: Quadrupole electrode geometry]</i></p>
</figure>
</p>

<p>
The standard form of a hyperbola is:
</p>
<p>
\[
\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
\tag{2.9}
\]
</p>
<p>
In our case, $a = b = r_0$, known as the hyperbola parameter, so that $x^2 - y^2 = r_0^2$. Then for all 4 rods we generally write:
</p>
<p>
\[
x^2 - y^2 = \pm r_0^2
\tag{2.10}
\]
</p>

<p>
Therefore, at the boudary of the rod we have:
</p>
  
<p>
\[
\Phi(x,y,t) \approx \pm C(t)r_0^2 + \Phi_0(t) \Rightarrow \begin{cases}
V_x(t) \\
V_y(t)
\end{cases}
\tag{2.11}
\]
</p>
  
<p>
where $V_x(t)$ and $V_y(t)$ are the rod potentials along the $x$ and $y$ axes, respectively.
</p>

<p>
So we have: $C(t)r_0^2 + \Phi_0(t) = V_x(t)$ and $-C(t)r_0^2 + \Phi_0(t) = V_y(t)$
</p>
  
<p>
With a bit of algebra, it can be shown that:
</p>
<p>
\[
C(t) = \frac{V_x(t) - V_y(t)}{2r_0^2}
\tag{2.12}
\]
</p>

<p>
Now, what about $\Phi_0(t)$? With a little more algebra we can show that:
</p>

<p>
\[
\Phi_0(t) = \frac{V_x(t) + V_y(t)}{2}
\tag{2.13}
\]
</p>
<p>
So in general, we have:
</p>
<p>
\[
\Phi(x,y,t) = \frac{V_x(t) - V_y(t)}{2r_0^2} (x^2 - y^2) + \frac{V_x(t) + V_y(t)}{2}
\tag{2.14}
\]
</p>

<p>
Experimentally, it is common to choose $V_x(t)$ and $V_y(t)$ such that their average is $0$. This is referred to as the <b>common-mode RF</b>. Specifcally: $V_x(t) = \frac{\phi_0(t)}{2}$ and $V_y(t) = -\frac{\phi_0(t)}{2}$ where:
</p>

<p>
\[
\phi_0(t) = U + V_RF cos(\Omega t)
\tag{2.15}
\]
</p>
<p>
Here, U is a DC offset parameter and $\Omega$ is the angular frequency.
</p>
  
<p>
Finally, after plugging in $V_x(t)$ and $V_y(t)$ into equation 2.14 we have the RF quadrupole potential for the linear Paul trap:
</p>

<p>
\[
\Phi(x,y,t) = \frac{\phi_0}{2r_0^2} (x^2 - y^2) 
</p>
  
<p>
This expression is commonly found in trapped-ion literature without explanation but now you understand its origin.

<h2>2.5 Equations of Motion</h2>

<p>
The motion of an ion in an electric field is governed by Newton’s second law. Substituting the quadrupole potential into the force law leads to a set of coupled, time-dependent differential equations.
</p>

<p><span class="eq-placeholder">(2.3) [Insert equation of motion for x-direction]</span></p>
<p><span class="eq-placeholder">(2.4) [Insert equation of motion for y-direction]</span></p>

<p>
After introducing dimensionless parameters and rescaling time, these equations take a standard mathematical form known as the Mathieu equation.
</p>

<p>
We do not derive this result here. A full derivation starting from the electric potential and leading to the Mathieu equation is provided in Appendix A.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>2.6 The Mathieu Equation</h2>

<p>
The canonical Mathieu equation has the form:
</p>

<p><span class="eq-placeholder">(2.5) [Insert Mathieu equation]</span></p>

<p>
The parameters appearing in this equation encode the physical properties of the trap, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>ion mass and charge</li>
  <li>trap geometry</li>
  <li>RF drive amplitude and frequency</li>
</ul>

<p>
Solutions to the Mathieu equation are either stable or unstable depending on the values of these parameters.

<h2>2.7 Secular Motion and Micromotion</h2>

<p>
In the experimentally relevant regime, the ion’s motion can be separated into two components:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a slow, smooth oscillation called <b>secular motion</b></li>
  <li>a rapid oscillation at the RF drive frequency called <b>micromotion</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
This separation becomes valid when one of the Mathieu parameters is small.
</p>

<p><span class="eq-placeholder">(2.6) [Insert approximate secular frequency]</span></p>

<p>
The secular motion resembles that of a particle in a harmonic potential, a fact that will become crucial when we later quantize the ion’s motion.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>2.8 The Pseudopotential Approximation</h2>

<p>
Rather than working directly with the full time-dependent equations of motion, it is often convenient to describe the ion as moving in an effective, time-independent potential known as the pseudopotential.
</p>

<p><span class="eq-placeholder">(2.7) [Insert pseudopotential expression]</span></p>

<p>
The pseudopotential provides a simple and intuitive picture of ion confinement and allows us to estimate trap depths and motional frequencies.
</p>

Under what conditions does the pseudopotential approximation break down?
</div>

<hr>

<h2>2.9 Outlook: From Classical Motion to Quantum Mechanics</h2>

<p>
In this chapter we have treated the ion’s motion classically. However, once the ion is sufficiently cold, its motional degrees of freedom must be described quantum mechanically.
</p>

<p>
In the next chapter we will quantize the ion’s motion, introduce phonon modes, and connect this picture to the internal electronic states of the ion. These ingredients together form the foundation of trapped-ion quantum computation.
