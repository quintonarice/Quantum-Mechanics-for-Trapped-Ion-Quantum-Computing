  <h4>Learning Objectives</h4>
  <ul>
    <li> Explain why purely static electric fields cannot stably confine charged particles, and describe how time-dependent fields circumvent this limitation.</li>
    <li> Describe the physical structure and operating principles of a linear Paul trap, including the distinct roles of RF and static electric fields.</li>
    <li> Derive the quadrupole RF potential from Laplace’s equation and electrode boundary conditions, and relate trap geometry to field curvature.</li>
    <li> Formulate and interpret the equations of motion for a trapped ion, including their reduction to the Mathieu equation and the physical meaning of the parameters $a$ and $q$.</li>
    <li> Distinguish between secular motion and micromotion, identify their characteristic timescales, and explain how micromotion depends on displacement from the RF null.</li>
    <li> Derive the pseudopotential approximation through time-scale separation and RF averaging, and justify which terms are retained or discarded using controlled approximations.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Quantized Motion of Trapped Ions</h1>

<p>
In this section we move from the classical description of the ion to the quantum mechanical description.
