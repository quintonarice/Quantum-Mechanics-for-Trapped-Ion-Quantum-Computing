<h1>Trapped Ions</h1>

<p>
In this section we transition discuss the physical system that will ultimately serve as our quantum computer: trapped atomic ions.
In 2000, D. P. DiVincenzo published, The physical implementation of quantum computation, in Fortschritte der Physik: Progress of Physics, 48, 771-783 which outlined five criteria for required for the realization of a quantum computer. 
</p>

<p> <b>DiVicenzo's Criteria:</b>
</p>
<p>
(1) (a) Qubits must be well characterized and easy to produce. (b) the system must be
scalable, i.e. must be able to manage an arbitrary number of qubits.
</p>
<p>
(2) It must be possible to reliably initialize a qubit to a fiducial state, e.g. |0⟩;
</p>
<p>
(3) A qubit must be stable over timescales larger than the typical time needed to operate
on it. The lifespan of a qubit over which it can maintain its quantum information content (before noise starts to destroy it) is known as coherence time. For a viable QC
system, the coherence time of the qubit must be greater than the computation time.
</p>
<p>
(4) It must be possible to implement a universal set of quantum gates.
</p>
<p>
(5) A reliable procedure must exist to read out the state of a qubit.
</p>
<p> While there are several candidates which can fulfill these criteria, we focus on atomic ions because in isolation,
  atoms naturally satisfy DiVincenzo's criteria via internal atomic states, which are identical from atom to atom, 

<p>
<b>How can a charged particle be confined in space at all?</b>
</p>

<hr>

<h2>2.1 Why Ions?</h2>

<p>
Ions are attractive candidates for quantum computation because they combine long-lived internal quantum states with excellent isolation from the environment. Unlike solid-state systems, individual ions can be prepared, controlled, and measured with extremely high fidelity using electromagnetic fields and laser light.
</p>

<p>
However, ions are charged particles, and charged particles respond strongly to electric fields. This makes confinement both possible and nontrivial. To appreciate why ion trapping is subtle, we begin with an important limitation of classical electromagnetism.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>2.2 Earnshaw’s Theorem and the Failure of Static Traps</h2>

<p>
Consider an ion placed in a static electric potential. The force on the ion is determined by the gradient of the electric potential, while the stability of the equilibrium depends on the curvature of that potential.
</p>

<p>
Earnshaw’s theorem states that it is impossible to achieve stable confinement of a charged particle using only static electric fields in free space.
</p>

<p><span class="eq-placeholder">(2.1) [Insert Laplace’s equation for electrostatic potential]</span></p>

<p>
Because the electric potential must satisfy Laplace’s equation in regions without charge, any static equilibrium point must be unstable along at least one direction. This means that purely static electric fields cannot trap ions in three dimensions.
</p>

<button class="collapsible">Exercise 2.1</button>
<div class="content-box">
Show that a local minimum of the electric potential is incompatible with Laplace’s equation in free space.
</div>

<p>
If static electric fields cannot trap ions, we must look for an alternative.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>2.3 Time-Dependent Electric Fields</h2>

<p>
The key insight behind ion trapping is that Earnshaw’s theorem applies only to static fields. By allowing the electric potential to vary in time, it becomes possible to achieve effective confinement.
</p>

<p>
In radio-frequency (RF) ion traps, electric fields oscillate rapidly compared to the typical motion of the ion. Although the instantaneous force may not be confining, the time-averaged motion can be stable.
</p>

<p>
This idea underlies the operation of the Paul trap, which is the central trapping technology used in modern trapped-ion quantum computers.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>2.4 Quadrupole Potentials</h2>

<p>
To understand RF trapping quantitatively, we begin with an idealized quadrupole electric potential. Near the center of the trap, the potential can be approximated as quadratic in position.
</p>

<p><span class="eq-placeholder">(2.2) [Insert ideal quadrupole potential]</span></p>

<p>
In practice, this potential is generated by applying a combination of static (DC) and oscillating (RF) voltages to carefully shaped electrodes.
</p>

<figure>
  <p><i>[Figure 2.1 Placeholder: Quadrupole electrode geometry]</i></p>
</figure>

<p>
The resulting electric field produces forces that alternate between focusing and defocusing directions as the RF voltage oscillates.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>2.5 Equations of Motion</h2>

<p>
The motion of an ion in an electric field is governed by Newton’s second law. Substituting the quadrupole potential into the force law leads to a set of coupled, time-dependent differential equations.
</p>

<p><span class="eq-placeholder">(2.3) [Insert equation of motion for x-direction]</span></p>
<p><span class="eq-placeholder">(2.4) [Insert equation of motion for y-direction]</span></p>

<p>
After introducing dimensionless parameters and rescaling time, these equations take a standard mathematical form known as the Mathieu equation.
</p>

<p>
We do not derive this result here. A full derivation starting from the electric potential and leading to the Mathieu equation is provided in Appendix A.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>2.6 The Mathieu Equation</h2>

<p>
The canonical Mathieu equation has the form:
</p>

<p><span class="eq-placeholder">(2.5) [Insert Mathieu equation]</span></p>

<p>
The parameters appearing in this equation encode the physical properties of the trap, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>ion mass and charge</li>
  <li>trap geometry</li>
  <li>RF drive amplitude and frequency</li>
</ul>

<p>
Solutions to the Mathieu equation are either stable or unstable depending on the values of these parameters.
</p>

<div class="content-box">
Identify the physical parameters that control the dimensionless Mathieu parameters a and q.
</div>

<hr>

<h2>2.7 Secular Motion and Micromotion</h2>

<p>
In the experimentally relevant regime, the ion’s motion can be separated into two components:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a slow, smooth oscillation called <b>secular motion</b></li>
  <li>a rapid oscillation at the RF drive frequency called <b>micromotion</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
This separation becomes valid when one of the Mathieu parameters is small.
</p>

<p><span class="eq-placeholder">(2.6) [Insert approximate secular frequency]</span></p>

<p>
The secular motion resembles that of a particle in a harmonic potential, a fact that will become crucial when we later quantize the ion’s motion.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>2.8 The Pseudopotential Approximation</h2>

<p>
Rather than working directly with the full time-dependent equations of motion, it is often convenient to describe the ion as moving in an effective, time-independent potential known as the pseudopotential.
</p>

<p><span class="eq-placeholder">(2.7) [Insert pseudopotential expression]</span></p>

<p>
The pseudopotential provides a simple and intuitive picture of ion confinement and allows us to estimate trap depths and motional frequencies.
</p>

<div class="content-box">
Under what conditions does the pseudopotential approximation break down?
</div>

<hr>

<h2>2.9 Outlook: From Classical Motion to Quantum Mechanics</h2>

<p>
In this chapter we have treated the ion’s motion classically. However, once the ion is sufficiently cold, its motional degrees of freedom must be described quantum mechanically.
</p>

<p>
In the next chapter we will quantize the ion’s motion, introduce phonon modes, and connect this picture to the internal electronic states of the ion. These ingredients together form the foundation of trapped-ion quantum computation.
